# Machine-Learning-For-Medical-Applications
## This repository contains projects wherein machine learning algorithms was used for various medical applications.
### [Project 1: Decision Trees - The Cart Algorithm](https://github.com/clairevania/Machine-Learning-For-Medical-Applications/blob/main/DecisionTrees.ipynb)
In this project, we will be programming our own decision tree CART algorithm with Gini criterion. 

To evaluate the algorithm we will be working with the [Early stage diabetes risk prediction dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Early+stage+diabetes+risk+prediction+dataset.) containing predictor variables about patients with diabetes and controls.
